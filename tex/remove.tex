However, PCA produces a linear transformation and may not acquire non-linear relationships in the original data. To remedy this, researchers have combined the linear results of PCA with autoencoders to extract non-linear relationships \cite{danaee2017deep}.

as principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to reduce the dimensionality of gene expression through orthogonal transformations \cite{danaee2017deep}. More recently,
